# Pre-Placement-Test

1.1 Introduction
In today's world everyone is travelling for jobs after Completion of their graduation. It has became need for each and every student, but for that they need to travel worldwide in searching of jobs. For simplicity of this whole hectic procedures we had proposed Online Campus Preparation because of earlier system is totally done manually by maintaining records, time consuming and very difficult to maintain coordination between student and companies.
The project is aimed at developing an online web application for the training and placement department of the college. The system is an online web application that can be accessed throughout the Institute with proper login provided. This system can be used as an application for the TPO of the college to manage the student information with regard to placement. Student logging should be able to upload their information. Organizations representatives logging in may also access/search an information put up by the students and also check aptitude exam result in Campus Preparation. TPO have to collect the information and manage them manually according to various streams. If any modification is required that is also to be done manually. Overall it will reduce the paper work and utilize the maximum capability of the setup and organization as well as it will save time and money.
The system focuses on automation of conventional Campus Preparation. This system can be used as an application for the Training & Placement Officers in the college to manage the student information with regard to placement and providing assistance using the assistance portal where students can post their query to the TPO and coordinators. Providing Student login helping them to update their personal and educational information in a form which will be added to the database and upload a resume and providing them with preparation materials for placements. An additional feature of the portal is a Exam Tab which will be providing campus preparation to shortlist the students as per their eligibility criteria and show the graph and result. It reduces the manual work and consumes less paperwork to reduce the time. Front end of the system is developed with the help of CSS,
Bootstrap, and HTML. Database management of this system will be done with the help of MYSQL database.
Campus Preparation automates activities of Training and placement cell and place the best coordination between student. Authorizing the student, communicating about the various exam for campus to the student community, managing the corporate relationship for inviting them for the placements as well other activities, monitoring the progress of the selection process and communicating with different users.
